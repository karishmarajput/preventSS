# EyeLoc
## Inspiration
User authentication is a fundamental component in most computer security contexts. It provides the basis for access control and user accountability. While there are various types of user authentication systems, alphanumerical username/passwords are the most common type of user authentication. They are versatile and easy to implement and use.
The inspiration for this project was that the traditional way of password authentication doesn't seem interesting and is not secure.

## What it does
### Basic Flow
#### While Registering
Here we gather information like colour, password,first name, last name and email while registering a new user, store it in database.
#### While Login
Here we use graphical method to take the password from the user so to prevent shoulder surfing.Shoulder surfing is using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder, to get information.
So even if someone is observing or shoulder surfing your password, we can protect our password using this graphical method.

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Challenges we ran into
We faced some problem while making the graphical method and fetch the data from the database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully implemented the project that provide us the way to prevent the shoulder surfing.

## What we learned
We learned about the shoulder surfing, how it works and we provide a method to stop it.

## What's next for EyeLoc
Future scope for EyeLoc would be to integrate it with the applications like banking where security is main feature and people can not afford to loose there password due to shoulder surfing.
